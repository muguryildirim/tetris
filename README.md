# Tetris Game
This project contains a Java-based implementation of the classic Tetris game. Tetris is an addictive game where different shapes need to be placed and lines need to be cleared to prevent stacking.

## How to Run

1. Clone the project to your development environment or computer.
2. Run the main class `Tetris.java`.
3. A "Tetris" window will open to start the game. You can control the game using arrow keys on your keyboard.

## Game Controls

- **Left Arrow Key**: Move the shape to the left.
- **Right Arrow Key**: Move the shape to the right.
- **Up Arrow Key**: Rotate the shape clockwise.
- **Down Arrow Key**: Accelerate the shape's downward movement.
- **Space Key**: Drop the shape instantly.
- **P Key**: Pause or resume the game.

## Game Rules

- The game continues until any unplaced shape reaches the top of the screen.
- Completed lines on the screen are automatically cleared, and the player's score increases.
- An unplaced shape can be moved or rotated as long as it does not collide with the shapes above.
- The objective of the game is to achieve the highest score, which is based on the number of cleared lines.
